# Description
Personal Project Repository for a Mozilla Firefox Pocket Esque link collection program. I chose this project to fill the need for a 
program that can store links in a more proactive, collective, and accesible way.

The app I would say is around 60 percent complete at this moment. I can currently save links to the local database model, google sign in and out functions perfectly, fragments and activities are functioning well. Need to build a link descriptor function and history 
fragment.

Google sign in services

# A list of aesthetic/cosmetic (not functional) improvements that you think would improve your app. This list should be ordered, with those that would give the most improvement (in your opinion) listed first.

Custom icons, a color scheme.
