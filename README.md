# LinkOrganizer
Personal Project Repository for a Mozilla Firefox Pocket Esque link collection program. Built to fill the need for a 
Program that can store links in a more proactive, collective, and accesible way.

The app I would say is around 60 percent complete at this moment. I can currently save links to the local database model, google sign in and out functions perfectly, fragments and activities are functioning well. Need to build a link descriptor function and history 
fragment.
