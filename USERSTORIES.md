 ## User stories
  
 # Story 1
 
 My name is Anne and I am in need of a one stop shop for all of my websites, links, videos, so on and so forth.
 This solves my problem because it gives me a less cluttered user experience compared to most
 web browser bookmarking systems.
 
 # Story 2
 
 My name is John Bradberry and this program solves my need to store links for all of my songs and tracks. Many songs
 are found on many different streaming services. Many are unavaliable on respective services.
 I can put links to each song on here and have them all in one place regardless of services.
 
 This app is in fact useful on it's own. I would imagine I am not the only one
 who is in need of a categorization of often visited websites. It can do what other programs do in part
